* simplify the synthdef API
 - get rid of synthdef-file from the users point of view and just
   deal with reading and writing single synths.
 - (synthdef-read path-or-url) ; return an sdef object
 - (synthdef-write sdef path-or-url) ; write to filesystem
 - (synthdef-bytes sdef) ; return a byte-array
 - (synthdef-print sdef) ; print to *out*

* return a basic sample "object" rather than an ID after loading a sample
 - modify hit and ctl to understand these instead of IDs
