=== Features:
* Audio samples: loading, playing, and manipulating
 - support a variety of file formats, not just wav

* Tempo and time management 
 
* (midi-in ...) (midi-out ...)
 - no args brings up chooser, string does an (re-find ) on the descriptions

* audio in and out
 - select line-in/out, mic...
 - show a scope along side the chooser and with a single click connect up
   so it's easy to see what you are hooking up with quickly

* Envelopes

* SynthDef mode
 - bring up the scope and an FFT window with some helpful controls for exploring sound spaces
 - either bring up a window or make it easy to do in code:
   * connect arpeggiators, chord progressors, midi-in, etc., to your
live instrument definitions so you can mess with the parameters and the synthdef while 
hearing useful audio input

* convert instrument definitions to clojure

* Arpeggiator(s)
* Chord progressors
 - create a library of things like 12-bar-blues, etc., and make it easy
to connect them up to instruments.

* Scales
 - add more knowledge about scale construction, modes, etc
 - create a library of interesting scales

* musical processes
 - lazy sequences of notes (combine or separate freq, velocity, duration?)
 - markov models (basically gets us finite state machines too right?)
(markov funky-jazz
  a 3 -> b  ; b 3 times more likely than c
  a -> c
  b -> d
  c -> d
  d -> a)

* synchronization 
 - so an overtone client can be in step with an externally generated clock
 - so multiple overtone clients can be in step
