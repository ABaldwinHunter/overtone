* although many Clojure arithmetic operators can take more than two args, we need
to convert these to binary-op-ugens for supercollider.  
  - so this: (+ foo bar baz) should become this (+ foo (+ bar baz))

* improve OSC receiving so messages can be received by path, (pattern match?) etc...

* setup an on-boot handler mechanism so we can load up synthdefs, connect
status machinery, etc...

* simplify the synthdef API
 - get rid of synthdef-file from the users point of view and just
   deal with reading and writing single synths.
 - (synthdef-read path-or-url) ; return an sdef object
 - (synthdef-write sdef path-or-url) ; write to filesystem
 - (synthdef-bytes sdef) ; return a byte-array
 - (synthdef-print sdef) ; print to *out*

* return a basic sample "object" rather than an ID after loading a sample
 - modify hit and ctl to understand these instead of IDs

* make the id counters in overtone.sc use a smarter algorithm so they can
reuse old IDs.
