== Overtone
=== Live-coding and musical exploration

A Clojure based musical generation and manipulation system for live-coding and more.

=== Requirements:

* SuperCollider synthesis server (scsynth) 
 - probably just needs to be on the path?

* Clojure

* A clojure editing environment that lets you easily evaluate and run code
 - VimClojure (my preference... and getting better every release)
 - Emacs with Slime
 
* jCollider library (java interfacing to SuperCollider using OSC)

* If you are on linux you'll want the SwingOSC system installed to for GUI support 
related to SuperCollider. (oscilloscope, etc...)

* abc4j library  (musical notation library)

-----------------------

Look at the "tests" for examples on how to make noise and do things.
