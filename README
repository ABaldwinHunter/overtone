== Overtone
=== Live-coding and musical exploration

A Clojure based musical generation and manipulation system for live-coding and more.

=== Requirements:

* SuperCollider synthesis server (scsynth) 
 - probably just needs to be on the path?

* Clojure

* A clojure editing environment that lets you easily evaluate and run code
 - VimClojure (my preference... and getting better every release)
 - Emacs with Slime
 
* jCollider library (java interfacing to SuperCollider using OSC)

* If you are on linux you'll want the SwingOSC system installed to for GUI support 
related to SuperCollider. (oscilloscope, etc...)

* abc4j library  (musical notation library)

-----------------------

Look at the "tests" for examples on how to make noise and do things.

The tune-up script in scripts is for quickly starting up your environment.
For example in linux we need to start Jack with the correct parameters, and
the jack.plumbing tool can be helpful for auto-routing connections.
